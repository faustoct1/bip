  <section>
    <h2 class="topic-title">1. How to Write Better Tweets</h2>
    <p class="highlight">Writing better tweets requires authenticity, value delivery, and engagement. Here are actionable tips:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Be Authentic:</strong> Share genuine updates, struggles, wins, and lessons. Use a casual and relatable tone.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on Value:</strong> Offer actionable takeaways from your experiences. Instead of “Launched my app today,” try, “Launched my app today 🚀 Here are 3 lessons I learned about user feedback.”</li>
      <li><strong>Hook Your Audience:</strong> Start with curiosity or relatable statements. Example: “I made 3 rookie mistakes building my app (so you don’t have to).”</li>
      <li><strong>Engage Your Audience:</strong> End with questions or calls to action. Example: “What’s one thing you wish you knew before launching your app?”</li>
      <li><strong>Use Threads:</strong> For detailed updates, start with a compelling tweet and break points into concise steps.</li>
      <li><strong>Add Visuals:</strong> Include screenshots, GIFs, or videos to make tweets stand out.</li>
      <li><strong>Consistency Matters:</strong> Tweet regularly and celebrate milestones with context.</li>
      <li><strong>Share Mistakes:</strong> Don’t shy away from failures—they’re relatable and engaging.</li>
      <li><strong>Experiment:</strong> Test different formats to see what resonates best with your audience.</li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2 class="topic-title">2. Why Many Fail to Deliver Value</h2>
    <p class="highlight">Avoid oversharing meaningless updates. Instead, create substance with these strategies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Move Beyond "Look at Me" Updates:</strong> Instead of “Launched a feature today,” explain why and how it helps users.</li>
      <li><strong>Think of Tweets as Teaching:</strong> Share lessons or insights your audience can learn from. Example: “Struggled to get TikTok traction until I tested 7-second videos. It doubled app signups in 3 days.”</li>
      <li><strong>Be Specific:</strong> Share behind-the-scenes processes and actionable tips.</li>
      <li><strong>Focus on Outcomes:</strong> Instead of “Tried TikTok ads,” say, “Spent $20 on TikTok ads with no results. Here’s why my targeting was off.”</li>
      <li><strong>Embrace Failures:</strong> Share mistakes and how you’re fixing them. Example: “I launched a feature nobody used. Here’s what I learned and how I’m pivoting.”</li>
      <li><strong>Break the Mold:</strong> Go deeper than surface-level updates. Share frameworks or decisions others can replicate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="topic-title">4. Should I Copy Other Accounts?</h2>
    <p class="highlight">It's tempting to replicate what successful accounts are doing, but copying blindly isn't the best approach. Here's why:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Learn, Don’t Copy:</strong> Look at successful accounts for inspiration, but add your unique twist. Tailor strategies to fit your style and audience.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus on Your Own Journey:</strong> Your personal experiences, mistakes, and learnings are what make your account stand out. Share those instead of mimicking someone else's story.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Echo Chambers:</strong> Following trends without adding value can lead to noise. Strive for originality to foster a unique community around your brand.</li>
        <li><strong>Iterate & Experiment:</strong> Instead of copying, experiment with different styles and approaches. Test what works for your audience and evolve from there.</li>
        <li><strong>Build Relationships:</strong> Engaging with your audience genuinely, rather than just copying content, creates a more authentic connection and trust.</li>

    <p class="highlight">Understanding your audience is key to delivering value that resonates. Here’s how you can figure it out:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Engage Directly:</strong> Ask your followers questions, run polls, or start conversations. This is the quickest way to get insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyze Feedback:</strong> Pay attention to comments, DMs, and engagement metrics. Look for patterns in what resonates with your audience.</li>

        <li><strong>Test & Learn:</strong> Experiment with different types of content and observe what gets the most engagement. Use that data to refine your approach.</li>
        <li><strong>Look at Competitors:</strong> See what similar creators or businesses are doing. What are their followers reacting positively to? Adapt those ideas to fit your brand.</li>
        <li><strong>Ask for Help:</strong> If you're unsure, ask your audience directly! A simple "What do you want to see more of?" can work wonders.</li>

  <section class="mb-5">
    <h2 class="topic-title">7. How to Launch New Features (Small Launches)</h2>
    <p class="highlight">Launching new features in a phased approach can help you gather feedback, improve user experience, and build excitement over time. Here's how to do it effectively:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Announce the Feature Early:</strong> Share teasers and sneak peeks to generate anticipation. Let your audience know when to expect the feature and how it will benefit them.</li>
        <li><strong>Beta Testing:</strong> Before the full release, roll out the feature to a small group of users for beta testing. Gather feedback to fine-tune the feature and identify any bugs or improvements.</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight the Value:</strong> When announcing the feature, focus on how it solves specific problems or enhances the user experience. Explain why it's important for users to try it.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep It Simple:</strong> Don’t overwhelm users with too many new features at once. Roll out small, manageable updates to avoid confusion and ensure a smooth adoption process.</li>
        <li><strong>Engage Users for Feedback:</strong> Actively encourage users to provide feedback after using the new feature. Use surveys, social media, or in-app prompts to gather insights and improve the feature further.</li>
        <li><strong>Use "Early Access" or "Limited Time Only" Offers:</strong> Create exclusivity by offering early access to the feature for a limited time. This builds excitement and drives more users to try it.</li>
        <li><strong>Announce Iterations:</strong> After the initial launch, continue to make improvements based on feedback. Keep your audience in the loop with progress updates and new enhancements.</li>
        <li><strong>Celebrate Small Wins:</strong> Don’t wait for major milestones to celebrate. Share updates on feature adoption, user success stories, and early positive feedback to keep momentum going.</li>
